# Countries and Capitals
	The goal for this project is that you can do the following, remember that
	you must meet each of the requirements.

#### **Cuntry:**
	After receiving this command the program should ask the name of
	country and expect the corresponding input, as a second step should ask the
	name of the capital I just enter and wait for input
	corresponding. Following this should give me the message:
	"Thank you for adding a country with its capital".
 
#### **Countries:**
	I must give the list of countries already entered.
 
#### **Capitals:**
	I must give the list of capital already entered.
 
#### **All:**
	I must give the list of countries with related capital.
 
#### **All Sorted by Capital:**
	I must give the same result as all but ordering the outputs
	alphabetically by name of the capital.
 
#### **All Mail:**
	I must send an email to "lgarcia@cognits.co" with Everything
