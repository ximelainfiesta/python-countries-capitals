1. What did you learn in this lesson?
-I learned how to involve functions in my code and to somehow put it inside a class. Also how to fix unicode problems, to make the answers titles and how to send emails.
2. Explain how you solved the storage of data.
-I created an empty dictionary and if the input data had everything necessary, it would get saved inside the dictionary. 
3. What is a dictionary and because it is important?
-A dictionary is an element inside python that helps me storage keys and items, this items may be lists, strings, or numbers. It doesnt order the elements though.
4. Explain how you solved the sort data.
-I searched in the internet ways to sort it, and I used a for loop that evaluated both key and items and then I used the function sorted, and later on I just printed them in the order. 
5. What are the best practices followed to build your application?
-First, documenting everything. 
-Second, have an order to code
-Third, use functions to recycle code
